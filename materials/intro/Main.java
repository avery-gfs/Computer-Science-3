// **Change Calculator**: Get a number `n` as input. Calculate the "change" for `n`; that is, the smallest set of quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies to make `n` cents.

// **Anagram Finder**: Download the file `unixdict.txt` (a list of words). Write a program that takes a word as input and finds all of its anagrams (from `unixdict.txt`). Words are anagrams of each other if they contains the same letters in a different order. For example, the anagrams of `time` are `mite`, `emit`, and `item`. Find the largest set of anagrams in the file.

// **Bar Chart**: Make a bar chart for a list of integers. For example, for the numbers (1 4 2 5 3) generate:

// ```
//    X
//  X X
//  X XX
//  XXXX
// XXXXX
// ```
