## 12(3)4 Puzzle

Starting with a number `n`, you have two choices:

1. You can subtract `3` from `n`:

```
n = n - 3
```

2. You can multiply `n` by `2`:

```
n = n * 2
```

You may repeat this process as many times as you like.

Starting from `n = 1`, can you reach `n = 24`? Either find a sequence of
transitions using the rules above that gets you from `1` to `24`, or prove that
none exists.

Hint: Look for a pattern in what numbers can and can't be reached starting from
`1` using these rules. Prove that this pattern always holds no matter how many
times the rules are applied.
