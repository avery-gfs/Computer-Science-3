# Syllabus: Computer Science 3

## Class Topics, Format, and Philosophy

In previous classes, you've learned the basics of programming and practiced writing software to solve a variety of problems. In this class, we will explore the more theoretical and advanced aspects of programming languages and software engineering. Possible topics include:

- Recursion
- Static typing and type systems
- Object oriented, functional, and asynchronous programming
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Design principles (modularity, orthogonality, encapsulation, composition, dry, zero-one-infinity, fail fast)
- Programming language internals (scope, garbage collection, floating point numbers, UTF8, pointers)
- Programming language development (grammars, parsers, interpreters, compilers, libraries)
- Algorithms (searching, sorting, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, string matching)
- Data structures (graphs, trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, persistent data structures)

The class will also prepare you to take the AP Computer Science A exam. As the exam approaches, we'll work on practice problems and review exam-specific information and strategies.

The specific material we cover is somewhat flexible. If there are other topics that you're interested in learning about, let me know and I'll try to incorporate them into the curriculum.

Our work in this class will be centered around a series of projects that each cover a new topic, with a structure that looks something like this:

1. Introduce a new topic
2. Technical details and demonstration
3. Project work in class
4. Out of class work (optional)
5. Release solutions
6. Review and discuss solutions

I think that the best way to learn software engineering is by reading and writing software, so we'll be doing a lot of that!

## Tech

Please make sure to have the following software installed for next class:

- Java (JDK version 17 or later) https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads
- A code editor (Visual Studio Code is recommended) https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

If you install Visual Studio Code, you should also install the Extension Pack for Java from Microsoft https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack. After you do, uninstall the IntelliCode extension from Microsoft.

## Grading and Workload

Grading for this class is pass/fail. You don't have to master all the material; as long as you participate in class and do the work, you'll pass. I'll give occasional quizzes as a tool to get feedback on my teaching, but your classwork and participation are what's important.

I know that you all have a lot on your plates, so I don't plan on assigning homework as long as our time in class is focused and productive. However, I will provide lots of optional problems and projects that you can work on outside of class if you want to explore the material on a deeper level.

## AI Tools

Generative AI tools can be a great asset when learning a new language and debugging code, but they're only one of many resources. As a software engineer, it's vital that you learn to utilize a wide set of tools when you encounter challenges, including:

- Official documentation
- Software Q&A sites
- Issue trackers and discussions
- Books and tutorials
- Reading source code
- Your teacher and your fellow classmates!

With this in mind, I ask that you not use AI tools for our in-class work. When doing work outside of class-time, you may use AI tools to get feedback on the code you write, but not to write code for you.

Do this:

> I wrote this function (your code here) to check if a number is prime, but it runs forever without returning a result. What am I doing wrong?

Don't do this:

> Write a function that checks if a number is prime.

You may not use Github Copilot, Replit AI, or other "code autocomplete" AI tools when doing work for this class.

## Feedback

I'll try to provide feedback on the code you write for this class. Writing code that works is only the first step of software engineering; the next step is figuring out how to make your code modern, simple, and efficient. My hope is that getting feedback will help you level-up this important aspect of your programming skills.
