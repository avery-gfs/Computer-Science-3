Changes for next time:

- Name starter code files `Main.java` to work with Replit
- Change problems in intro into template code
- Start off with easier sequence algorithms, stuff like minimum, average, etc
- Don't to sorting until later in the year, after getting more practice with
  Java
- Motivating examples: you don't know how to do this, now you will learn
