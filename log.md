Changes for next time:

- Name starter code files `Main.java` to work with Replit
- Change problems in intro into template code
- Start off with easier sequence algorithms, stuff like minimum, average, etc
- Don't to sorting until later in the year, after getting more practice with
  Java
- Motivating examples: you don't know how to do this, now you will learn
- Either short feedback cycles (solve multiple problems and go over solutions in
  a single class period), or long (multiple days working on a problem set).
  Medium (one problem in class time) doesn't work as well, harder to time and
  worse engagement.
- Class should be taught in Python. Java doesn't lend itself well to exploring
  algorithms, and Python now gives us the ability to work with static types.
