Outline:

- Java basics
- Primitives
- IO
- Control structures
- Methods
- Sequence types
- Hashed types
- Enums and switch
- Classes
- Generics
- Interfaces
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Algorithmic analysis
- Recursion
- Reading software
- Design principles
- Refactoring
- Testing
- Computer internals
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Programming language design and implementation
- AP review

Design principles:

- Modularity
- Orthogonality
- Encapsulation
- Composition
- DRY
- Zero-one-infinity
- Fail fast
- Immutability
- Persistence
- Fault-tolerance
- Idempotence
- Total vs partial
- Side effects

Changes for next time:

- Name starter code files `Main.java` to work with Replit
- Change problems in intro into template code
- Start off with easier sequence algorithms, stuff like minimum, average, etc
- Don't to sorting until later in the year, after getting more practice with
  Java
- Motivating examples: you don't know how to do this, now you will learn
- Either short feedback cycles (solve multiple problems and go over solutions in
  a single class period), or long (multiple days working on a problem set).
  Medium (one problem in class time) doesn't work as well, harder to time and
  worse engagement.
- Class should be taught in Python. Java doesn't lend itself well to exploring
  algorithms, and Python now gives us the ability to work with static types.
- Present chessboard problem as lecture instead of assigning it
